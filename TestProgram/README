*****Check Test Framework***** 

We are using Check as our unit testing framework. It was inspired by similar frameworks,
the most famous example being JUnit for Java.

Main characteristics:
	- uses fork() to separate the namespace.
	- Test can be grouped. unit tests > test case > Suite
	- Fixtures feature.
	- Integrated with autotools, to run the test just 'make check'
	- Multiple output formats, i.e xml, allowing to integrate it on a Jenkins CI server


* Links of interest:

Check webpage: http://check.sourceforge.net/
Check manual (with examples): http://check.sourceforge.net/doc/check_html/index.html


* Install:

Probably it is included in your distribution repositories,
$ sudo apt-get install check

For the last version, download the code here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/check/files/
untar and build the code:

$ reconfigure --install
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install (as root)  


* Usage:

Add the test folders and this macro to the main configure.ac:
			PKG_CHECK_MODULES([CHECK], [check >= 0.9.4])
This macro is the substitute of AM_PATH_CHECK(). This one is deprecated but is still present in the manual, 
if you get any error while loading shared libraries or during the autoreconf, use the new one.

Write the test Makefile.am, there are an example in this folder or in the check manual.
Write your tests. You can also find the check manual example in '/usr/share/doc/check/example'.


* Jenkins integration.

Check support available in xUnit 1.23 plugin.


* Errors & fixes

ERROR:
TestProgram/.libs/lt-check_libgtp: error while loading shared libraries: libcheck.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

FIX:
 The PKG_CHECK_MODULES([CHECK], [check >= 0.9.4]) macro should pass the link directories correctly. An alternative is to add the 
 linker directory to ld: 

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib"

To make it permanent, you can edit the ldconfig files. First, create a new file such as:

sudo vi /etc/ld.so.conf.d/libcheck.conf

Second, add the path in the created file

/usr/local/lib

Finally, run ldconfig to update the cache.

$ sudo ldconfig

FIX:
AM_PATH_CHECK() is deprecated use the macro below instead:
PKG_CHECK_MODULES([CHECK], [check >= 0.9.4])
