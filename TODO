TODO list - Road Map - Limitations

* Autotools:
	- Find a proper way to include automaticaly mysql.m4 with autoreconf, enabling the removal of old acinclude.m4 

* Workflow and State Machines additions:
	- Implement the Failure workflow of the procedures. Failure workflows are not implemented on current version
	because these MME is intended for a first study of MME virtualisation feasibility. 
	- Including NAS timers. NAS timers have been considered as no essential on a first version because they are
	 used to manage failure workflows.
	- Direct forwarding and Indirect forwarding during Handovers are not complete because the other EPC nodes
	doesn't support these procedures. Further tests and fixes are needed.

* Node Manager Module (nodemgr.c):
	- Only getNode() function reads the node information of the configuration file. 
	The rest of the functions are dummy functions.

*S11:
	- Add support for Echo Request, Echo Response or Version not supported (GTPv2).
	Implementation on the State Machine and the s11 handler (mme/MME.c 241).
	
*Improve MME-UE-S1AP-ID - Session struct mapping. Currently an array of pointers is used as a temporal solution.
	The mapping can be merged with the pending response hash table. In general, the functions present on MME.c.
	could be improved and realocated to converge to an object-oriented design.

*libgtp: 
	- The library can be decoupled from the early libgtp version to support only GTPv2 and remove the gsn
	structures.

*NAS:
	- Check authentication. (mme/S1/NAS/NAS_FSM.c 419).
	- Activate Security Mode Procedure (mme/S1/NAS/NAS_FSM.c 422). First the NAS cipher and integrity check should
	 be implemented on the libNAS.
	- Implement timers.

* libNAS:
	- Implement NAS cipher and integrity check of the messages.
* libS1AP:
	- Implement decoder and encoder of missing IE, ie #96 - S-TMSI
	
* Encoding and decoding libraries:
	- The messages not used may contain errors, specially on libNAS.

* HSS is emulated using a MariaDB or MySQL database. The tests show the MME is able to manage up to 12000 UE. The 
database shall be optimized. Why an empty database has a better performance when it is used after it is created
than if when it is used after deleting the UE information? (see project results).
